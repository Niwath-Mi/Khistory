          <h1>King Jayavarman II</h1>
          <p>
            Founder of the Khmer Empire, reigned from 802 to 835 AD. the
            dominant civilisation on the Southeast Asian mainland until the mid
            15th century. He was a powerful Khmer king who overthrew the rule of
            the Shailendra Dynasty from Java. Historians formerly dated his
            reign as running from 802 AD to 835 AD. Before Jayavarman II came to
            power, there was much fighting among local overlords who ruled
            different parts of Cambodia. The country was not unified under one
            ruler. No inscriptions by Jayavarman II have been found. Future
            kings of the Khmer Empire described him as a warrior and the most
            powerful king from that time frame that they can recall.

          <h1>King Norodom Sihanouk</h1>
          <p>
            King Norodom Sihanouk was a prominent figure in Cambodian history,
            serving as king, prime minister, and head of state at various times.
            He played a crucial role in Cambodia's independence from French
            colonial rule and was known for his efforts to maintain Cambodia's
            neutrality during the Vietnam War. His reign saw both periods of
            prosperity and turmoil, including the rise of the Khmer Rouge.
            Sihanouk's legacy is complex, as he is remembered for his
            contributions to Cambodian nationalism but also for his
            controversial alliances during times of conflict.

          <h1>Pol Pot</h1>
          <p>
            Pol Pot was the leader of the Khmer Rouge and the Prime Minister of
            Democratic Kampuchea from 1976 to 1979. He is infamous for his role
            in orchestrating the Cambodian genocide, which led to the deaths of
            approximately two million people. His brutal regime aimed to create
            a classless agrarian society, resulting in widespread famine, forced
            labor, and mass executions that devastated Cambodia.

            Hun Sen is a Cambodian politician who has served as the Prime
            Minister of Cambodia since 1985. He is one of the longest-serving
            leaders in the world and has played a significant role in shaping
            Cambodia's post-Khmer Rouge political landscape. His leadership has
            been marked by both economic growth and controversies regarding
            human rights and political repression.
